alot of problems with the shipping info, where a local run works fine but when uploaded to github it does not capture the right info, i tried alot of fixes
the best one i found was to use the browser that is built into github and not install any external one this had the most consistency.

cleaned the data to remove duplicates and empty rows down from 1500 lines to 300 since alot of the deals where repeating so no point in keeping multiple copies
